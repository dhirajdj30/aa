Again do not compare the quality; just the features. \nBuild quality: 4/5\nUltra bass 2.0: 5/5\nSound by Dirac: 5/5\nBattery: 4/5\nPros:\n1) Sound quality by Direc is amazing. \n2) It has 4 HD quality mics with wind reduction feature. Although the person on the other side of the call can still hear 10% of wind blast when on bike. \n3) In ear deduction and find my earbuds works accurately. \n4) Transperancy mode and ANC mode are good at this price point. Tried the ANC mode while playing 70-80DB sound in background. It was quite impressive. Again do not compare it with airpods pro 2nd generation. \n\nCons:\n 1) The build quality of the earbuds and the box are average with a matte finish. No lanyard was included in the box as advertised. \n2) Ultra bass 2.0 is a gimmick its just a normal bass. \n3) Battery life span could've been better considering that it only lasts for 5-6 hours with ANC enabled. \n4) Light grey is the new white. So consider it as white.",

The fitting was not that snug in my ears I have to adjust them time to time to make them secure inside otherwise one comes loose and the in ear detection pauses whatever is playing, and another thing I didn't like was at high volumes there is too much sound leakage so people around you can hear clearly what you are listening to, in quiet rooms even medium volumes have sound leakage, otherwise all other features are awesome the anc,the in ear detection, the battery backup, google fast pair works like a charm just open the case and it gets connected, one feature I think it misses is there is no option for tap to play or pause content you either have to take out one of the ear buds to pause or you have to do it manually, the transparency mode is okish not that great, the hinge on the case is loose as other people also pointed out and the last thing is the battery indication is not accurate it will show 100 percent until it reaches 90 directly then 80and so on it doesn't show the accurate number of battery percentage left, overall it is a decent tws considering the price and the features offered in this price I would recommend. Ps: I forgot to mention the latency is also ok not bad I played few bgmi and cod matches with these on and they were pretty good but still would choose any wired earphones over these in case of gaming.",
